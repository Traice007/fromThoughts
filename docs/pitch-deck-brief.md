## INSTRUCTIONS FOR CLAUDE.AI

Create a professional pitch deck presentation (Google Slides or PDF artifact) with the following design language and slide content. This is for cold outreach to B2B founders in the Netherlands (both native Dutch and international founders — deck is in English).

### Design Language

**Brand name**: fromThoughts
- "from" is rendered in Playfair Display italic, lighter weight, in a muted/slate color
- "Thoughts" is rendered in bold, dark/white depending on background
- No space between "from" and "Thoughts" — it reads as one word: fromThoughts

**Color palette**:
- Primary background (dark slides): #0f172a (slate-900) to #1e293b (slate-800), gradient
- Light background (data slides): #ffffff with #f8fafc (slate-50) accents
- Accent/CTA color: #f59e0b (amber-500), hover: #fbbf24 (amber-400)
- Text on dark: #ffffff (primary), #94a3b8 (slate-400, secondary), #fbbf24 (amber-400, highlights)
- Text on light: #0f172a (slate-900, primary), #475569 (slate-600, secondary), #d97706 (amber-600, highlights)
- Border/divider on dark: rgba(255,255,255,0.1)
- Border/divider on light: #e2e8f0

**Typography**:
- Headings: Clean sans-serif (Geist or Inter), bold
- Body: Same sans-serif, regular weight
- Brand name: Playfair Display italic for "from" + bold sans-serif for "Thoughts"
- Keep text minimal — this is a pitch deck, not a document

**Visual style**:
- Clean, minimal, lots of whitespace
- Dark slides for emotional/narrative sections
- Light slides for data/evidence sections
- Subtle gradients, no hard color blocks
- Rounded corners on cards/containers (border-radius: 12-16px)
- No stock photos — use icons, data visualizations, and clean typography instead
- Amber accent used sparingly for emphasis (stats, key numbers, CTAs)

**Tone of voice**:
- Direct, no fluff (Dutch audience values directness)
- Founder-to-founder, not salesperson-to-prospect
- Confident but not arrogant
- Data-backed claims, no vague promises
- No emojis, no exclamation marks

### SLIDE CONTENT

**Total slides: 10-12 max. Keep each slide to one idea.**

---

#### SLIDE 1 — Title (dark background)
**fromThoughts**
AI-Powered Revenue Execution for B2B Founders

*Subtitle*: Turn your revenue target into a plan your first sales hire can actually execute.

*Small text bottom*: fromthoughts.com

---

#### SLIDE 2 — The Problem (dark background)
**Heading**: You're still closing every deal yourself.

Content (short bullets, not paragraphs):
- You've found product-market fit. Revenue is growing. But it's all you.
- Every deal depends on your time, your relationships, your judgment.
- You know you need to hire — but you've heard the horror stories.

---

#### SLIDE 3 — The Brutal Reality (light background, big numbers in amber)
**Heading**: The numbers nobody tells you.

Show these as large, prominent statistics:
- **70%** of first VP of Sales hires fail within 12 months (SaaStr)
- **€900K+** opportunity cost of a bad sales hire (Cosmic Partners)
- **81%** of European seed-funded startups never reach Series A (Dealroom/Atomico, 22K+ rounds)
- **74%** of startups fail due to premature scaling (Startup Genome)

Small text: "Hiring a VP of Sales before you have a repeatable process is the most expensive mistake a founder can make."

---

#### SLIDE 4 — Why It Fails (dark background)
**Heading**: The playbook isn't the problem. The feedback loop is.

Content:
- You write a playbook. Train the rep. Hand over the deals.
- Revenue drops 40% in the first quarter.
- The playbook captured *what* you do — not *why* you do it in that specific moment.
- What's missing isn't documentation. It's your ongoing judgment about what to do with changing data.

---

#### SLIDE 5 — What Founders Try (light background, comparison table)
**Heading**: What you've probably already considered.

| Option | Cost | The catch |
|---|---|---|
| Fractional VP of Sales | €72K-120K/year | Knowledge walks out the door when they leave |
| Sales consultant | €50K-100K/year | Delivers a slide deck, not a system |
| Enterprise tools (Gong, Clari) | €20K-50K/year | Built for 10-50 person teams, not founders |
| CRM (HubSpot, Salesflare) | €2K-5K/year | Tracks deals but doesn't tell you which ones to chase |
| Doing it yourself | Your time | Doesn't scale. That's why you're here. |

---

#### SLIDE 6 — The Gap (dark background, visual whitespace emphasis)
**Heading**: The missing layer.

Show as a simple diagram or visual:
- CRM = where you track deals
- Lead tools = where you find prospects
- fromThoughts = **what to do next** (the strategic layer between your data and your execution)

"Every tool tells you *what happened*. None of them tell you *what to do about it*."

---

#### SLIDE 7 — What fromThoughts Does (light background, 3 cards)
**Heading**: From revenue target to execution plan.

Three cards:
1. **Revenue Gap Analysis**
   Input your numbers. See exactly where your plan has gaps: pipeline, conversion, capacity, or market positioning.

2. **Execution Playbook with OKRs**
   Get a structured plan with priorities and measurable targets your first hire can execute on day one.

3. **Ongoing Review**
   Your plan adapts as your pipeline evolves. Not a one-time report — a continuous system.

---

#### SLIDE 8 — The Dutch Context (light background)
**Heading**: Built for where you are right now.

Content:
- **21.5% scaleup ratio** in NL — vs. 54% in the US (Techleap 2025). Most Dutch startups never make it past early stage.
- **50% fewer Series A deals** in the €4-15M segment last year. You can't afford to get the commercial hire wrong.
- **42% surge in Dutch attrition rates** vs. 10% across Europe. Sales is one of the two most critical skills gaps (Techleap/Ravio).
- **€5.5M average Dutch startup valuation** vs. €55M in the US (McKinsey). Every euro counts more here.
- fromThoughts is built for European B2B founders at €300K-1.5M annual revenue — ~750-850 companies in NL alone. The stage where the right plan matters more than the right hire.

---

#### SLIDE 9 — Who Built This (dark background)
**Heading**: Ranjith Claessens

Content:
- 10+ years building commercial operations at B2B companies from scratch
- Employee #2 at a SaaS startup — built the entire sales, marketing, and service operation
- Led teams of up to 14 across SaaS, tech, and consultancy
- Based in Utrecht. Previously at Quan, Pera, Kaizo, SendCloud.

"I kept solving the same problem manually. Now it's software."

---

#### SLIDE 10 — Pricing Context (light background)
**Heading**: A fraction of the alternative.

Simple comparison:
- Fractional VP of Sales: **€80K-120K/year**
- Sales Consultant: **€50K-100K/year**
- fromThoughts Starter: **€1,500** (one-time, 30 days full access)
- fromThoughts Pro: **€15,000/year** (continuous)

"The plan most founders need costs less than one month of a fractional VP."

---

#### SLIDE 11 — CTA (dark background, amber accent)
**Heading**: Let's talk.

Content:
- I'm looking for 5 founders to work with closely as design partners.
- 20-minute call. No pitch — I want to hear what you're dealing with.
- If fromThoughts can help, I'll show you how. If it can't, I'll tell you.

#### SLIDE 12 (optional) — One-liner close (dark background)
**Heading in large text**:

"Stop guessing. Start executing."

### NOTES FOR PRESENTATION GENERATION
- Each slide should have minimal text — this is a pitch deck, not a report
- Use the amber (#f59e0b) color for key numbers and stats to make them pop
- The comparison table on slide 5 should be clean and easy to scan
- Slide 3 (brutal stats) should be visually impactful — large numbers, not buried in text
- Alternate between dark and light backgrounds to create visual rhythm
- The overall feel should be: serious, data-driven, founder-to-founder, European
