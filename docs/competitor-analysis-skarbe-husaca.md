# Competitor Analysis: Skarbe & Husaca — What fromThoughts Can Learn

*Last updated: February 2026*

---

## Skarbe — "The Invisible CRM"

**HQ:** Krakow/San Francisco | **Funding:** $600K pre-seed | **Users:** 2,500+ | **Pricing:** $95-175/month

### What They Do
AI sales assistant that eliminates CRM admin. Lives in your Gmail/Outlook sidebar. Automatically captures every call, email, and meeting. Suggests next actions. Drafts follow-up emails. Monitors deals 24/7.

### The "Next Best Actions" Feature (what caught our eye)
Not generic reminders ("follow up with John") but context-aware, specific recommendations:
- "Based on yesterday's call where the prospect mentioned concerns about implementation time, send them the case study showing 2-week deployment, and reference their Q2 deadline"
- Analyzes deal history, conversation patterns, and winning patterns
- Drafts ready-to-send content (one-click approval)
- Proactive: suggests actions before deals stall, not after

### Key Claims
- Teams close 30% more deals thanks to timely follow-ups
- Conversion rates increase by 20% after switching
- Zero manual data entry required

### Target Audience
Solo founders and small sales teams. "Simple enough for solo founders, powerful enough for teams." $95-175/month makes it accessible to bootstrapped companies.

### Strengths
- Zero-input architecture (automatic data capture)
- Lives where work happens (email sidebar, not separate app)
- Specific, actionable output (drafts emails, not just recommendations)
- Always-on (24/7 monitoring vs. weekly check-ins)
- Low price point, freemium available

### Weaknesses
- **Purely tactical**: No strategic layer. Doesn't know if your pipeline is healthy, if your ICP is right, or if you're ready to hire.
- **No benchmarking**: Can't tell you if a 3% demo-to-close rate is good or bad for your stage
- **No team management**: Can't coach a rep or assess team performance
- **No hiring guidance**: Doesn't know when you should add headcount
- **No founder-specific context**: Same tool for a $100K and $10M company

## Husaca SIP — Sales Improvement Program

**HQ:** Amsterdam | **Experience:** 25+ years | **Pricing:** ~€5,000-7,000/month | **Methodology:** Proprietary HUSACA framework

### What They Do
Strategic sales consultancy using an integrated three-level framework:
1. **Strategic** (Organizational Excellence): Business model alignment, strategic planning
2. **Tactical** (Commercial Excellence): Sales process analysis, funnel optimization
3. **Operational** (Human Excellence): Team coaching, talent optimization, velocity

### The SIP Program (what caught our eye)
Three-step diagnostic and improvement process:
1. **Performance Mapping**: Team composition, funnel structure, PMF, market reach, competition, conversion results
2. **Velocity Scan**: Proprietary diagnostic producing a "velocity score" — measures team speed, flow, and responsiveness
3. **Optimization & Coaching**: Strategy/process review using HUSACA methodology, team coaching

### The HUSACA 6-Step Sales Methodology
- **H**: Human-Centered Goals (beyond business metrics — how goals affect people)
- **U**: Unique Value Proposition (emotional connection, not just features)
- **S**: Sales Process Alignment (match process to buyer behavior)
- **A**: Advocate Development (build internal champions at customer org)
- **C**: Competitive Analysis (beyond product comparison — financial positioning, Value Net)
- **A**: [Sixth step not fully documented]

### Strengths
- **Holistic**: Doesn't just fix sales — integrates strategy, process, and people
- **Human-centric**: Recognizes that sales talent leaves due to unhappiness, not just bad process
- **Proprietary diagnostic**: The velocity score gives a measurable baseline
- **Deep expertise**: 25+ years, scientific research foundation
- **Amsterdam-based**: Understands Dutch market norms

### Weaknesses
- **Human-limited**: One consultant can serve 10-15 clients max
- **Expensive**: €60K-84K/year for an ongoing engagement
- **Knowledge walks out**: When the engagement ends, the methodology leaves
- **No AI leverage**: All analysis is manual
- **No continuous monitoring**: Point-in-time assessments, not always-on
- **No deal-level guidance**: Works at strategy/team level, not individual deal level
- **Project-based**: Not designed for continuous partnership

## What fromThoughts Should Build (Inspired by Both)

### 1. "Monday Brief with Next Best Actions" (Phase 1)
Combines Weekly Brief + Skarbe-style specificity, but at the sales manager level.

Every Monday, the founder and rep(s) get:
- **3 priority deals** with specific next actions (not "follow up" but "reference the implementation concern from Tuesday's call and send the case study showing 2-week deployment")
- **1 pipeline alert** (coverage dropping, stage bottleneck, deal gone cold)
- **1 coaching nudge** (pattern the AI noticed: "Your rep closes faster when they do a second stakeholder call — suggest it for Deal Y")
- **Health Score update**: "Your score moved from 58 to 62 this week"

This is what a sales manager does in a Monday standup — automated at €15K/year instead of €80K+.

### 2. "fromThoughts Health Score" (Phase 1-2)
Inspired by Husaca's Velocity Score, but continuously computed from live data.

Single dashboard number (0-100):
- **Pipeline Score** (30%): Coverage, deal count, value distribution
- **Velocity Score** (25%): Stage progression speed, stall rate, time-to-close
- **Execution Score** (25%): Activity levels, follow-up speed, next-action completion
- **Readiness Score** (20%): Process maturity, documentation, hire-readiness signals

The founder checks one number. Drill into which component is dropping. See specific actions to fix it. Over time: "We were at 45 when we started, now we're at 72. We're ready to hire."

### 3. "Deal Intelligence Cards" (Phase 2)
Each deal gets:
- **Deal Score**: Likelihood to close
- **Next Best Action**: The one thing to do this week
- **Risk Flag**: What could go wrong
- **Founder Involvement Needed?** Yes/No — crucial for the refined ICP (founders with reps who need to know which deals still need them)

### 4. "Performance Mapping on Autopilot" (Phase 2)
Husaca charges €5-7K/month for manual Performance Mapping. fromThoughts does it automatically:

**Onboarding diagnostic** (one-time):
- Team composition questionnaire
- Pipeline import + historical analysis
- Win/loss pattern analysis from CRM data
- ICP clarity assessment
- Process maturity score

**Ongoing re-assessment** (monthly):
- Auto re-runs as new data flows in
- Trend lines: "Your ICP fit improved from 45% to 68%"
- Structural flags: "70% drop-off between demo and proposal — your biggest leverage point"

### 5. "Hire Readiness Trigger" (Phase 3)
Neither Skarbe nor Husaca does this explicitly.

Based on Health Score + pipeline data, fromThoughts proactively tells the founder:
- "You're ready for hire #2. Here's the profile, comp benchmark for NL, and onboarding plan."
- Or: "Not ready yet. Your process isn't documented enough. Here are 3 things to fix first."

The single most valuable thing a sales manager does — and no tool offers it.

## Objections & Cons: What a Skeptical Dutch Founder Will Say

### Objection 1: "You're not comparable to Husaca. They put a person in my office."
**The challenge:** Husaca provides a senior sales leader sitting in pipeline reviews, coaching reps live, attending customer calls. fromThoughts provides AI + a monthly call with Ranjith. These are not the same thing. A Dutch founder will say: "You're comparing apples and oranges to justify your price."

**Honest answer:** They're right — it's not 1:1 the same. fromThoughts trades depth of personal involvement for breadth of continuous monitoring. Husaca gives you 2 days/week of a senior person. fromThoughts gives you 24/7 AI monitoring + 1 strategic session/month with someone who's built this at 4 companies. Different trade-off, not a straight replacement. Be upfront about this.

**How to handle it:** Don't claim to replace Husaca. Position as the step *before* Husaca: "Use fromThoughts to build the foundation. If you outgrow it and need a fractional VP in person, you'll be ready — and you'll save 6 months of diagnostic work because we've already done it."

### Objection 2: "€15K/year is 3% of my revenue. That's expensive for a tool."
**The challenge:** A founder at €500K revenue sees €15K as significant. Dutch founders are price-conscious. They'll calculate the hourly rate: €15K ÷ 12 calls = €1,250 per session. "I can get a coach for €200/hour."

**Honest answer:** The monthly call is not the product. The product is the 24/7 AI monitoring + Weekly Briefs + pipeline intelligence + the strategic framework. The call is where Ranjith adds judgment the AI can't (yet). If you break it down: €15K/year = ~€1,250/month = less than 1 day of a fractional VP. And unlike a coach, the AI runs every day.

**How to handle it:** Show the total cost of the alternative, not per-hour: "A fractional VP is €80K-120K/year. A failed hire costs €150K+. Even a part-time sales coach at €200/hour × 8 hours/month = €19,200/year — and they don't bring the AI layer." Also: offer quarterly payment to reduce the perceived commitment.

### Objection 3: "Skarbe does the deal stuff for $95/month. Why not Skarbe + ChatGPT for strategy?"
**The challenge:** Savvy founders will say: "I'll use Skarbe for $95/month for deal automation and ask ChatGPT for strategy. That's $120/month vs. your €1,250/month."

**Honest answer:** They can try. ChatGPT doesn't know their pipeline, their conversion rates, their team dynamics, or their market. It gives generic frameworks. Skarbe doesn't know if their pipeline is healthy or if they're ready to hire. The founder becomes the integration layer — stitching together generic AI advice with deal-level automation. That works if they have the time and expertise. If they had that, they wouldn't need a sales manager.

**How to handle it:** "You could. But the whole point is that you don't have time to be your own sales manager. That's why you're stuck. fromThoughts is the integrated system — strategy + execution + data, connected. The value isn't any single piece, it's that they talk to each other."

### Objection 4: "Show me one case study. One founder who used this and it worked."
**The challenge:** Dutch founders want proof. "Bewijs het maar." No case studies = no trust. This is the biggest objection for the first 5-10 customers and there's no shortcut around it.

**Honest answer:** You don't have case studies yet. Be honest about it.

**How to handle it:** "I don't have fromThoughts case studies yet — I'm looking for 3-5 design partners to build them with. What I do have is 10 years of doing this manually at Quan, Kaizo, SendCloud, and Pera. The frameworks in fromThoughts are the same ones I used to build commercial operations from scratch at those companies. I'm now turning that into software. If you're willing to be one of the first, I'll give you more of my time than any future customer will ever get."

Frame the lack of case studies as an advantage for early adopters: more personal attention, more influence on the product.

### Objection 5: "You're one person. What if you get sick? What if you pivot?"
**The challenge:** Dutch founders think about risk. A one-person company with no funding is a risk. What's the continuity plan?

**Honest answer:** It's a legitimate concern. The AI system + the execution plan + the pipeline data stay with the customer even if Ranjith is unavailable. The product doesn't depend on a single person being available on a Tuesday — it depends on the system running. The monthly calls are valuable but not mission-critical.

**How to handle it:** "The system runs independently. The AI monitors your pipeline, generates the Weekly Brief, and tracks your Health Score whether I'm available or not. My monthly review adds strategic depth, but if I'm out for a week, nothing breaks. And everything — your plan, your data, your playbook — lives in your fromThoughts account, not in my head."

### Objection 6: "Your Health Score is just a made-up number. How do I know the benchmarks apply to my business?"
**The challenge:** Dutch founders are analytical. They'll question the methodology. "My B2B healthcare company has a 9-month sales cycle. Your benchmark says 3 months. Your score is useless."

**Honest answer:** Generic benchmarks are dangerous at this stage. Every company is different. A 3% close rate might be excellent for enterprise and terrible for SMB.

**How to handle it:** The Health Score needs to be calibrated per company, not generic benchmarks. On signup, establish *their* baseline metrics. The score tracks improvement against *their own* history, not against an abstract benchmark. "Your velocity improved 23% vs. last quarter" is more useful than "You're at 62/100." Use industry benchmarks as context ("companies at your stage typically see X") but measure progress against themselves.

### Objection 7: "I don't have a clean CRM. My data is in spreadsheets and email."
**The challenge:** Many companies at €500K-1.5M have messy or no CRM data. If the AI needs clean pipeline data to generate insights, and the data doesn't exist, the product doesn't work.

**Honest answer:** This is real. The product is only as good as the data feeding it. Pipeline import from CSV/Sheets helps, but if the founder's "CRM" is a mental model in their head, fromThoughts can't analyze what doesn't exist.

**How to handle it:** Two approaches: (1) The onboarding process includes a "pipeline audit" — help them structure their existing deals into a clean format as part of getting started. This is a service, not just a tool. (2) Position this as a *benefit*: "Part of what fromThoughts does is force you to get organized. When you hire your next rep, they'll inherit a structured pipeline instead of chaos. That alone is worth the investment."

### Objection 8: "What does the AI actually do that I can't do with ChatGPT?"
**The challenge:** The most dangerous objection. Every founder has ChatGPT. They can paste pipeline data and ask for analysis. Why pay €15K for what looks like a fancy wrapper?

**Honest answer:** On day one, the difference is smaller than you'd like. The execution plan and OKRs *could* theoretically be generated by a skilled ChatGPT user. The difference grows over time: persistent context (ChatGPT forgets), continuous monitoring (ChatGPT doesn't watch your pipeline), accumulating pattern recognition (ChatGPT starts fresh every conversation), and Ranjith's strategic judgment layered on top.

**How to handle it:** Don't compete on AI capability. Compete on the *system*: "ChatGPT can answer a question. fromThoughts runs your sales operation. It knows your pipeline from last week, your conversion trends from last quarter, and what changed since Monday. It doesn't start from scratch every time you open it. And it comes with someone who's built this at 4 companies telling you what the data actually means."

### Objection 9: "€15K is your starting price. What's your real price?"
**The challenge:** Dutch founders negotiate. They'll assume listed price is the starting point for a conversation. "Questions about pricing? Let's talk" (which we already removed from the site) would have been an open invitation to haggle.

**How to handle it:** Hold the price. Don't negotiate. The moment you drop the price, the perceived value drops with it. Instead, offer structured flexibility: "The price is €15K/year. I can offer quarterly payments of €3,750. For the first 3 design partners, I'll add an extra monthly strategy session at no additional cost." Add value, don't reduce price.

### Objection 10: "This sounds like you're building the plane while flying it."
**The challenge:** Perceptive founders will see that the product roadmap (Health Score, Deal Intelligence, Hire Readiness) is a vision, not reality. The current product is a one-time report. They'll ask: "When does all of this actually exist?"

**Honest answer:** They're partially right. Be transparent about what's live now and what's coming.

**How to handle it:** "You're right — some of this is being built. That's exactly why I'm looking for design partners, not just customers. You'll get my direct involvement, influence on what gets built, and a product that's shaped around your actual needs. In 6 months, you'll have a system nobody else's early customers helped design."

## The Uncomfortable Truths

1. **The product-market fit for the current product is uncertain.** The execution plan + OKRs is useful, but it's not the recurring value that justifies €15K/year. Until the Weekly Brief and pipeline monitoring are live, the Pro tier is essentially "Ranjith's consulting, structured by AI." That's a valid service, but be honest about what you're selling.

2. **The hybrid model is the value, and it's also the bottleneck.** Ranjith's involvement is what makes it worth €15K. It's also what limits growth to 15-20 clients. Every product decision should be: "How do I encode what I do on this call into the AI so next time the AI handles 50% of it?"

3. **The first 5 customers will define the product.** Don't over-build before you have real users. The roadmap above is a hypothesis. The actual build order should be determined by what the first 3-5 design partners actually need, not by what looks good in a feature comparison with Skarbe and Husaca.

4. **Dutch founders will respect honesty more than polish.** Don't oversell the AI. Don't promise what doesn't exist. Say: "Here's what I've built. Here's what I'm building. Here's what I personally bring. And here's why the first 5 founders who work with me will get a disproportionately good deal." That's a Dutch pitch.
