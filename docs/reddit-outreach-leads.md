# Reddit Outreach — Validation Interview Leads

*Created: February 2026*
*Purpose: Find B2B founders at €300K-€1.5M ARR struggling with founder-led sales for validation interviews*

## Approach

1. **Engage genuinely first** — comment with real value from your experience at Quan, Kaizo, SendCloud, Pera. Don't mention fromThoughts.
2. **DM the poster** — reference their specific post, frame as research: "I'm building something for founders at this exact stage. Would you be open to a 20-min chat?"
3. **Track status below** — update as you go.

## DM Template

> Hey [name] — saw your post about [specific problem]. I've been on both sides of this — as the commercial hire brought in to "figure it out" and as someone who's helped founders build their first sales motion at a few B2B companies.
>
> I'm working on something specifically for founders at your stage and your post really resonated with what I keep hearing. Would you be open to a quick 20-minute chat? Not selling anything — genuinely trying to learn what founders like you need most right now.
