# Landing Page Terminology Research — Hero Term for fromThoughts

*Created: February 2026*
*Purpose: Find the right term to replace "sales playbook" in hero copy and positioning*

---

## Why Not "Playbook"

"Sales playbook" is the default term across all fractional VP sales services, agencies, and
competitor tools (Activated Scale, Revenue Nomad, Bedrock Sales, QC Growth, Founding Sales,
and virtually every other player in the space). It signals a document you download, not a
system you operate. It forces fromThoughts to compete on the same shelf as free HubSpot
content. At EUR 15K/year, this undermines premium positioning.

## Competitor Language Map (18 sources researched, Feb 2026)

### What competitors call the deliverable they build

| Term | Who uses it | Saturation |
|---|---|---|
| Sales playbook | Everyone | Very high — avoid |
| Sales engine / GTM engine | QC Growth (hero), Revenue Nomad, Activated Scale | Growing, not yet saturated |
| Sales system / structured sales system | Revenue Nomad, Bedrock Sales | Common, functional |
| Sales process | Almost everyone | Generic — avoid |
| Sales motion | Pete Kazanjy / Founding Sales (concept, not product) | Credible, not yet productized |
| Sales operating system | Bedrock Sales only | Strong, rare |
| Revenue Flow™ | SalesLead (France) | Proprietary — interesting model |
| Revenue engine / revenue machine | Revenue Nomad UK | Used, not dominant |

### What is completely unclaimed

- **"Sales doctrine"** — zero appearances across all 18 sources
- **"Sales architecture"** — appears only in blog posts, never hero copy
- **"Commercial architecture"** — absent entirely
- **"Sales mechanism"** — not found in any competitor positioning
- **"Revenue mechanism"** — not found in any competitor positioning

### EU/NL-specific note

Husaca and SalesViking (the two Dutch competitors) use **no founder-transition language at all**.
They target established sales organizations. This confirms the whitespace in the Dutch market
for fromThoughts' specific positioning.

## ICP Language (from Reddit research)

Founders at the exact target stage describe their own pain in these words:

- *"Sales is locked in my head"*
- *"My sales process can't be replicated"*
- *"Nobody knows the why like I do"*
- *"I finally stopped doing sales calls. Revenue dropped 40%."*
- *"I can't afford a fractional VP"*
- *"The role didn't exist yet when I hired"*

Key insight: they use the word **"sales"** not "revenue" or "commercial." They think of the
problem as a sales problem, not a revenue operations problem. Terms should mirror their
vocabulary.

## Terms Analyzed and Rejected

| Term | Reason for rejection |
|---|---|
| Sales playbook | Saturated, competes with free VC-backed content |
| Sales magic | Implies no structure — opposite of what ICP wants. Too whimsical for EUR 15K B2B |
| Sales engine | QC Growth's hero headline — following, not leading |
| Sales architecture | Rare but only in secondary content, not hero copy |

---

## Terms Still in Consideration (Feb 2026)

| Term | Strength | Risk |
|---|---|---|
| **Sales doctrine** | Completely unclaimed, premium, principled | Requires explanation — not instantly obvious |
| **Sales motion** | Credible (Kazanjy's canonical term), not productized | Abstract without context |
| **Sales mechanism** | Unclaimed, functional, neutral | Forgettable on its own |
| **Revenue mechanism** | Unclaimed, slightly boardroom-adjacent | "Revenue" prefix more crowded than "sales" |
| **Commercial architecture** | Premium, European sensibility | Cold, may need warming copy |

---

## Key Insight: The Unproductized Whitespace

Revenue Nomad (the most articulate fractional VP content source) uses the closest language
to what fromThoughts actually delivers:

> *"Your experience becomes an embedded asset instead of a personal bottleneck."*

No competitor has named the act of extracting founder sales knowledge into a transferable
system. That transition — from intuition to documented, scalable process — has no category
term yet. Whoever names it owns it.

## Next Steps

- Validate terminology in initial ICP conversations (listen for what words founders use themselves)
- Consider proprietary branding (e.g. "the fromThoughts [term]") once a term is validated
- Decision pending — do not update landing page until term is confirmed through validation
