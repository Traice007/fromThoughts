# GTM Strategy — 7 Design Partners by Q2 2026

**Goal:** 7 paying design partners before June 30, 2026.
**Timeline:** ~4.5 months from Feb 21, 2026.
**Budget assumption:** €0 paid marketing. All relationship-based, LinkedIn-first.

## Design Partner Framing

Not a sales pitch — a co-creation invitation.

**The ask:**
> "We're working with a small group of founders as design partners — you help us make the product right for exactly this situation, and in exchange you get direct access and founder pricing."

**Design partner pricing:**
- Foundation equivalent: €7,500 (vs. €15,000 production — 50% off)
- Growth equivalent: €8,000 (vs. €19,000 production — 58% off) — includes Ranjith directly as revenue strategist

**Why the discount:** Design partners are co-investors in the product's direction. Their time and feedback is part of the value exchange.

**The one-page proposal covers:**
1. The problem you saw in their discovery call answers
2. What you'll build together
3. The terms (price, time commitment, what they get)
4. Why you're limiting to 7 design partners

## The 5 LinkedIn Buying Signals — Act Within 72 Hours

These are the highest-value triggers. Monitor daily.

1. **Head of Sales / VP Sales job posting** — company size 11–50, NL/DE/Nordics, B2B SaaS. This is the clearest possible signal. Outreach: "Saw you're hiring your first Head of Sales — the hardest part isn't finding the person, it's giving them something to run with."

2. **Seed or Series A funding announcement** — reach out 2–4 weeks post-announcement. Founder is in planning mode, board is asking for a revenue growth plan. Highest receptivity.

3. **Founder posts about sales team frustration** — "we've hit X ARR but can't replicate what I do in sales with the team." Comment with genuine perspective first, then DM.

4. **Founder adds CRO / CCO / Head of Sales to their own title** — signals they're formally owning the sales function because they haven't hired yet. Late-stage founder-led sales.

5. **Named in Techleap Rise, SaaSiest Top 100, or Sifted Rising 100** — high-growth, founder-led, scaling. Cross-reference against signals 1–4.

**LinkedIn saved search to set up now:** "Head of Sales" + Netherlands/Germany + 11–50 employees.

- Private member club. The €300K+ ARR tier is exactly fromThoughts's ICP.
- Book the try-out session.

### Use as Prospect Lists (Not Communities to Join)

**Techleap Rise Alumni** — techleap.nl

- ~90 founders have gone through the programme. Alumni include TestGorilla, Lepaya, ChannelEngine, Crisp.

---

## VC and Accelerator Targets

**Important:** Approach VCs only after you have 2–3 design partners. VCs refer tools they've seen work, not tools they've only heard pitched.

### Tier 1 — NL (Highest Priority, Weeks 8–12 after design partners)

**Peak Capital** (Amsterdam) — peak.capital
- The only Dutch VC that leads explicitly with GTM support as their investment thesis. Portfolio companies are all exactly in fromThoughts's ICP.
- Entry: Warm intro through a Peak portfolio company (become a design partner first).
- Differentiator: They publish the Benelux SaaS Landscape report — contributing perspective is a non-pitch path to visibility.

**Newion** (Amsterdam) — newion.com
- "Leading European B2B SaaS early stage VC, based in Amsterdam, investing across BeNeLux, DACH & Nordics." ~60 portfolio companies, exactly the right stage.
- Approach: Identify 5 Newion portfolio companies at €300K–1.5M ARR and approach them as prospects first. Then use traction to ask Newion for a referral to other portfolio companies.

**Volta Ventures** (Amsterdam + Belgium) — volta.ventures
- Heavy Benelux B2B SaaS focus. Small team = personal outreach viable.
- Review portfolio at volta.ventures/our-portfolio for 5–8 companies at the right ARR stage.

**Additional NL VCs:**
- **HenQ** (Amsterdam) — B2B software startups, €500K–€5M tickets
- **Curiosity VC** — AI-first B2B software, pre-seed to Series A
- **Dutch Founders Fund** — vertical SaaS, B2B marketplaces, €250K–€3M

### Tier 2 — Germany (Weeks 10–16)

**Point Nine Capital** (Berlin) — pointnine.com
- Pure-play B2B SaaS seed VC. 205 portfolio companies. "P9 Family" = curated ~200 founder network with shared playbooks.
- Key contact: Seth DeHart (Venture Partner, former operator) — most likely to advocate for fromThoughts as a portfolio resource.
- Engage with Christoph Janz's content on LinkedIn (blog: chrija.medium.com) to build visibility in the P9 network before reaching out.

**Project A Ventures** (Berlin) — project-a.vc
- Only European VC with an embedded sales function supporting portfolio companies (140+ in-house experts). They are structurally predisposed to recommend external GTM tools.
- Approach their sales/GTM practice lead directly.

### Accelerators

**Techleap.nl** — mandate to connect tools with Dutch scaleups. Approach as an ecosystem partner, not a vendor.

**Target accelerator alumni (graduated 1–3 years ago):**
- UtrechtInc — literally local, strong B2B tech portfolio
- YES!Delft — deep tech and B2B SaaS
- Rockstart — multiple programs including B2B
- Startupbootcamp (Amsterdam)
- Techstars (various European programs) with Dutch alumni

---

## Referral Partners

**Nobel Recruitment** — nobelrecruitment.com
- Europe's leading SaaS GTM recruitment firm. Talks to founders who are hiring their first Head of Sales — the hottest buying signal for fromThoughts.
- Approach: Propose a referral arrangement. You solve the problem before the hire; they place the hire. Non-competing, mutually reinforcing.

**Jurjen van Rees** — linkedin.com/in/jvanrees / jurjenvanrees.substack.com
- Amsterdam-based fractional sales leader and Substack writer. Covers the exact same problem space.
- Not a competitor — he's a person, fromThoughts is a platform. He works with clients at the beginning of the transition; fromThoughts productizes the output.
- Approach as a potential referral partner or co-sell arrangement.

**Sales recruitment firms (approach for referrals when founders are "too early" for their services):**
- CRS Consultants (NL) — market leader in sales recruitment, also interim sales managers
- SalesQuarters (NL) — fractional commercial executives
- RedFoxBlue (Hoofddorp) — interim sales management since 2000

**CRM communities and partnerships:**
- Salesflare — Benelux-native, small enough to be approachable for co-marketing
- HubSpot for Startups — has a Dutch partner ecosystem
- Pipedrive — popular with SMBs in Europe
- Pitch: "Your new users who are B2B founders need a strategy before they need a CRM — we can help."

**Accountants and financial advisors:**
- Dutch founders at €300K–1.5M talk to their accountant more than anyone. These advisors see the P&L and know when revenue growth is stalling.
- Target boutique accounting firms serving startups in Utrecht, Amsterdam, Eindhoven.

**nlgroeit mentoring network:**
- 540+ mentors working with scaling SMEs. Their mentees are the ICP.
- Play: Get in as a mentor or partner to access companies at the right stage.
- Website: nlgroeit.nl

## Additional Channel Tactics

### Reddit (warm leads already identified)
Founders who publicly posted about being stuck in founder-led sales. Specific leads tracked in `docs/gtm/reddit-outreach-leads.md`.
- **Status:** [ ] Not started
- See reddit-outreach-leads.md for specific targets and DM templates.

### LinkedIn Content — Own the Dutch "Founder-Led Sales" Topic
Almost no Dutch-language LinkedIn content exists on "eerste sales hire," "sales opschalen," or "founder-led sales." This is a wide-open content gap.

**Content ideas:**
- "Why 70% of first VP of Sales hires fail (and what Dutch founders can do instead)"
- "I've helped 4 B2B companies build their sales engine from scratch. Here's the pattern I keep seeing."
- "Your first sales hire doesn't need a playbook. They need a system."
- Share market stats (from `docs/strategy/market-stats.md`) with founder-friendly commentary
- **Status:** [ ] Not started

### Hiring Signal Monitoring
Monitor Dutch job boards for B2B startups posting their **first sales role**.

- **Where to monitor:** LinkedIn Jobs, Indeed.nl, The Hub (thehub.io), Welcome to the Jungle
- **Search terms:** "First sales hire", "Sales Representative" at companies <20 employees, "Business Developer" at early-stage startups
- **Outreach angle:** "I saw you're hiring your first sales rep. Most founders I've worked with wish they had an execution plan before that hire, not after."
- **Status:** [ ] Not started

### Techleap Finder
finder.techleap.nl — free database of Dutch startups filterable by sector, stage, revenue model.
- Action: Build a target list of 50–100 companies, cross-reference with LinkedIn to find founders.
- **Status:** [ ] Not started

### Pavilion Amsterdam Chapter
Private community for GTM leaders in Netherlands/Belgium. Not direct ICP (established GTM people), but they know founders who are struggling with this. Good for warm introductions and referrals.
- **Status:** [ ] Not started

### Failed Fundraise as a Trigger
With 50% fewer Series A deals in 2024, many Dutch founders are stuck between seed and Series A.
- **Where to find them:** Leapfunder, Symbid, angel investor networks (LUMO Labs, Dutch Angels)
- **Outreach angle:** "You need revenue growth to raise your next round, but can't afford a €150K hire to get there."
- **Status:** [ ] Not started

### Dutch Podcasts and Newsletters
One podcast episode reaching 500 founders in your niche is worth more than 500 cold DMs.
- Target: Sprout Podcast, De Ondernemer, EU Startups Podcast, StartupJuncture
- **Pitch angle:** "Why 70% of first sales hires fail, and what Dutch founders should do instead"
- **Status:** [ ] Not started

### Free Revenue Readiness Scorecard (Build When Ready)
Publish a free, ungated 5-minute self-assessment: "Are you ready for your first sales hire?" Everyone who scores "not ready" is a warm lead.
- Could start as a simple Typeform/Tally form, build into fromThoughts later.
- **Status:** [ ] Not started

## What NOT to Do

- No mass LinkedIn requests without personalization
- No pitching in We Love SaaS or SaaSiest Slack until you've contributed value for weeks
- No VC approaches before you have design partners
- No content marketing funnel, case study building, or website optimization until 7 design partners are signed — every hour there is an opportunity cost
