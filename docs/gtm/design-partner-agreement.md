## What This Is

fromThoughts is building an AI-powered platform that turns a founder's sales knowledge into a repeatable sales mechanism their team can execute. We are working with a small number of early-stage companies as Design Partners — founders who help shape the product in exchange for direct access, reduced pricing, and a closer working relationship with the fromThoughts team.

This is not a standard subscription. It is a structured collaboration.

---

## What fromThoughts Provides

- Full access to the fromThoughts platform for the duration of the agreement
- Direct involvement from the fromThoughts founding team in onboarding and setup
- Monthly 45-minute pipeline and execution review call (Growth tier equivalent)
- Async access to the fromThoughts team via email for questions and feedback
- Priority consideration for all new features during the agreement period
- Design Partner pricing as specified below — locked in for 12 months

---

## What the Design Partner Provides

- A minimum of 2 hours per month engaged with the platform (using it, not just reviewing it)
- Honest, specific feedback — what works, what doesn't, what's missing
- Participation in one 30-minute product feedback call per quarter
- Permission for fromThoughts to reference the company name and general outcomes (e.g. "working with a B2B SaaS founder in the Netherlands at €Xm ARR") in anonymised case studies and investor materials unless otherwise agreed in writing

The Design Partner does **not** need to publicly endorse fromThoughts during the agreement period, though any testimonials or case studies shared publicly would be appreciated and agreed separately.

**Selected tier:** _________________________

**Total amount due:** _________________________

**Payment terms:** Full amount due within 14 days of signing this agreement. Bank transfer or card payment accepted.

## Confidentiality

Both parties agree to keep the terms of this agreement confidential. fromThoughts will not share the Design Partner's revenue figures, pipeline data, or commercially sensitive information with third parties without explicit written consent.

The Design Partner acknowledges that fromThoughts platform output, frameworks, and methodology are proprietary to fromThoughts Inc.

---

## What Happens After the Agreement Period

At the end of the 12-month period, the Design Partner has the option to:

1. Continue at the then-current standard pricing
2. Renew at a Design Partner Alumni rate (to be agreed — expected 20–30% below standard pricing)
3. Conclude the relationship with no further obligation

fromThoughts will reach out at least 60 days before the end date to discuss next steps.

---

## Early Termination

If the Design Partner is not satisfied with the platform or the working relationship within the first 30 days, fromThoughts will issue a full refund. No questions asked.

After 30 days, the agreement runs to its end date. Early termination without refund is possible by mutual written agreement.

---

## Governing Law

This agreement is governed by the laws of the Netherlands. Any disputes will be resolved by mutual discussion first. Neither party intends to litigate.
