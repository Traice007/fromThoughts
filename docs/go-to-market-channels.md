# Go-to-Market Channels — Finding First Users

*Last updated: February 2026*
*Goal: Find 5-10 design partners / first paying users among Dutch B2B founders at €300K-1.5M ARR*

---

## Priority Tier 1 — Highest intent, lowest friction

### 1. Reddit (warm leads already identified)
Founders who publicly posted about being stuck in founder-led sales. Specific leads tracked in `docs/reddit-outreach-leads.md`.

- **Why it works**: They already described the problem in their own words. Zero cold outreach friction.
- **Action**: Comment with genuine value, then DM. See outreach template in the leads doc.
- **Status**: [ ] Not started

### 2. LinkedIn Outbound — Dutch B2B founders without a sales leader
Search for founders/CEOs at Dutch B2B startups with 5-20 employees where no VP of Sales or Head of Sales is listed on the company page. That absence is the signal.

- **Why it works**: Direct access, highly targeted, you can personalize based on their company
- **Search filters**: Title = Founder/CEO/Co-founder, Location = Netherlands, Company size = 2-50, Industry = B2B SaaS/Tech
- **Outreach angle**: Reference their specific situation, not a generic pitch
- **Status**: [ ] Not started

### 3. LinkedIn Content — Own the Dutch "founder-led sales" topic
Research found almost no Dutch-language LinkedIn content on "eerste sales hire", "sales opschalen", or "founder-led sales." This is a wide-open content gap.

- **Why it works**: You'd be the only Dutch voice on this topic. Even 2-3 posts could surface inbound interest.
- **Content ideas**:
  - "Why 70% of first VP of Sales hires fail (and what Dutch founders can do instead)"
  - "I've helped 4 B2B companies build their sales engine from scratch. Here's the pattern I keep seeing."
  - "Your first sales hire doesn't need a playbook. They need a system."
  - Share the brutal stats from our research with founder-friendly commentary
- **Reference**: Richard van der Blom (Dutch LinkedIn strategist, trained 300K+ professionals) for content strategy best practices
- **Status**: [ ] Not started

## Priority Tier 2 — High potential, requires some setup

### 4. Hiring Signals as Lead Triggers
Monitor Dutch job boards for B2B startups posting their **first sales role**. That's the exact moment a founder is deciding how to transition — and the moment they're most anxious about getting it wrong.

- **Where to monitor**: LinkedIn Jobs, Indeed.nl, The Hub (thehub.io), Welcome to the Jungle
- **Search terms**: "First sales hire", "Sales Representative" at companies with <20 employees, "Business Developer" at early-stage startups
- **Outreach angle**: "I saw you're hiring your first sales rep. Most founders I've worked with wish they had an execution plan before that hire, not after."
- **Why it works**: Zero-cost, high-intent signal, very specific timing
- **Status**: [ ] Not started

### 5. VC Portfolio Mining
Dutch VCs publish their portfolio companies. Their seed and Series A investments are exactly the ICP. Some VCs have "platform" teams that help portfolio companies with go-to-market — fromThoughts could be a resource they recommend.

- **Target VCs and their portfolio pages**:
  - **Peak Capital** (Amsterdam) — early-stage B2B SaaS focus
  - **Keen Venture Partners** (Amsterdam) — seed/Series A
  - **Newion** (Amsterdam) — European B2B software
  - **Inkef Capital** (Amsterdam) — tech/deep tech
  - **Volta Ventures** (Belgian, active in NL) — seed-stage software
  - **Northzone** (has Amsterdam office) — early-stage
  - **Endeit Capital** (Amsterdam) — growth stage
- **Two plays**:
  1. Browse portfolio pages, identify B2B companies in the right range, reach out to founders directly
  2. Reach out to the VC platform/portfolio support team and offer fromThoughts as a resource for their founders
- **Why it works**: Concentrated list of verified companies, potential for warm intros through the VC
- **Status**: [ ] Not started

### 6. Techleap Finder
[finder.techleap.nl](https://finder.techleap.nl/dashboard) — free database of Dutch startups filterable by sector, stage, and revenue model (including SaaS).

- **Why it works**: Official, verified data. Can filter for B2B companies in the seed-to-Series A range.
- **Action**: Build a target list of 50-100 companies, cross-reference with LinkedIn to find founders
- **Status**: [ ] Not started

### 7. Utrecht/Dutch Accelerator Alumni Networks
Accelerators produce B2B startups in the exact right range. Alumni who graduated 1-3 years ago are likely at €300K-1.5M now.

- **Target accelerators**:
  - **UtrechtInc** — literally in your backyard, strong B2B tech portfolio
  - **YES!Delft** — deep tech and B2B SaaS
  - **Rockstart** — multiple programs including B2B
  - **Startupbootcamp** (Amsterdam)
  - **Techstars (various European programs)** with Dutch alumni
- **Two plays**:
  1. Reach out to alumni founders directly
  2. Offer to do a workshop/session on "building your first sales process" — positions you as expert, surfaces leads naturally
- **Why it works**: Concentrated audience, shared context, warm-ish (you're in the same ecosystem)
- **Status**: [ ] Not started

## Priority Tier 3 — Longer-term, relationship-based

### 8. Pavilion Amsterdam Chapter
Private community for GTM leaders in Netherlands/Belgium. Not direct ICP (established GTM people), but they **know** founders who are struggling with this. Good for warm introductions and referrals.

- **Action**: Join the community, build relationships, position yourself as the go-to person for early-stage revenue ops
- **Status**: [ ] Not started

### 9. CRM Communities & Partnerships
Founders who just signed up for their first CRM are at the stage where they're formalizing sales. They've got the tool but not the strategy.

- **Salesflare** — Benelux-native, small enough to be approachable for a partnership or co-marketing
- **HubSpot for Startups** — has a Dutch partner ecosystem
- **Pipedrive** — popular with SMBs in Europe
- **Play**: Engage in user communities/forums, or approach the CRM company about a referral partnership ("your new users who are B2B founders need a strategy before they need a CRM — we can help")
- **Status**: [ ] Not started

### 10. Sales Recruitment Firms as Referral Sources
CRS Consultants, SalesQuarters, and RedFoxBlue all talk to founders about to make the "first sales hire" decision. Some founders aren't ready for a €6K-10K/month fractional VP — they're "too early." That's your opening.

- **Pitch to the firm**: "When a founder comes to you but isn't ready for a fractional VP yet, send them to fromThoughts first. We'll get them to the point where your services make sense."
- **Why it works**: Non-competitive, mutually beneficial. They get better-prepared clients, you get warm leads.
- **Status**: [ ] Not started

### 11. Failed Fundraise as a Trigger
With 50% fewer Series A deals in 2024, many Dutch founders are stuck between seed and Series A. They need to show revenue growth to raise, but can't afford the VP hire.

- **Where to find them**:
  - **Leapfunder** (Dutch angel/crowdfunding platform) — companies that raised seed but not Series A
  - **Symbid** (Dutch crowdfunding)
  - Angel investor networks: **LUMO Labs**, **Dutch Angels**
- **Outreach angle**: "You need revenue growth to raise your next round, but can't afford a €150K hire to get there."
- **Status**: [ ] Not started

### 12. nlgroeit Mentoring Network
540+ mentors working with scaling SMEs. Mentors aren't your buyers, but their mentees are.

- **Play**: Get in as a mentor or partner to access companies at the right stage
- **Website**: [nlgroeit.nl](https://nlgroeit.nl/mentoring-voor-ondernemers/)
- **Status**: [ ] Not started

### 13. Accountants and Financial Advisors
Dutch founders at €300K-1.5M talk to their accountant more than anyone. These advisors see the P&L and know when revenue growth is stalling.

- **Play**: Referral partnership with boutique accounting firms that serve startups (Utrecht, Amsterdam, Eindhoven)
- **Why it works**: Quiet but consistent lead source. Accountants are trusted advisors.
- **Status**: [ ] Not started

### 14. Dutch Podcasts and Newsletters
One podcast episode reaching 500 founders in your niche is worth more than 500 cold DMs.

- **Target podcasts**:
  - Sprout Podcast (Dutch startup media)
  - De Ondernemer
  - EU Startups Podcast (English, European audience)
  - StartupJuncture (Dutch startup news)
- **Pitch angle**: "Why 70% of first sales hires fail, and what Dutch founders should do instead"
- **Status**: [ ] Not started

## Priority Tier 4 — Scalable, requires build

### 15. Free Revenue Readiness Scorecard
Publish a free, ungated 5-minute self-assessment: "Are you ready for your first sales hire?" Everyone who scores "not ready" is a warm lead.

- **Distribution**: LinkedIn posts, accelerator newsletters, community shares
- **Why it works**: Scales reach without scaling time, pre-qualifies leads
- **Build effort**: Could be a simple Typeform/Tally form to start, or built into fromThoughts later
- **Status**: [ ] Not started
