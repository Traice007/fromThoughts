## Dominant Frameworks Shaping Founder Thinking

### 1. Seth DeHart's 6-Phase Model (Point Nine Capital / Growth Unhinged)
- Probably the most influential framework in Europe
- Advised 80+ B2B startups including Typeform, Attio, incident.io, SuperAnnotate
- Runs **Founder Led Sales**, a free community of 250+ founders
- Core thesis: there is no transition "out of sales" — roles transition, but at least one founder is the steward of revenue forever
- 6 phases from finding PMF through hiring a sales leader
- Based at Point Nine Capital (Berlin) — strong European credibility
- At SaaStanak 2025: sales is a process that can be broken down, documented, and improved

### 2. Pete Kazanjy's "Founding Sales"
- Canonical book on founder-led sales
- Key threshold: don't transition until you've done at least 50 sales demos and have a repeatable win rate of 20%+
- Widely cited across Reddit, Indie Hackers, and LinkedIn

### 3. Jason Lemkin / SaaStr's "Hire 2 Reps" Rule
- Hire 2 reps at first, not 1 — run an A/B test
- Don't hire someone who hasn't worked at a startup
- Not ready for a VP of Sales until you have 2 reps hitting quota

## What Founders Actually Try (and Failure Modes)

### 1. Hire a VP of Sales from a bigger company
- Most common and most expensive mistake
- **68% leave within 18 months** (OpenView)
- Mark Roberge (HubSpot's first sales leader, hired 200+ people) warns: "Often startups get greedy and go after the big name leader. The first question she will ask when joining is 'where is my assistant?'"
- Roberge also flags that founders overweight industry experience — most folks at HubSpot came from outside marketing software, even outside tech altogether

### 2. Hire 1-2 junior SDRs
- Cheaper alternative that usually also fails
- No guidance, no strategy, no execution expert to point them in the right direction
- Best case: 1-2 meetings per week. Worst case: €40-80K wasted + 6 months lost

### 3. Fractional sales consultant/coach
- Typically €20-50K/year, helping 10-15 companies at a time
- Limitation: "unless you have a lot of time available to go through generalized trainings and then figure out how to apply it to your own startup, you are not likely to find this beneficial"

### 4. Mid-level AE (3-7 years experience) as first hire
- Emerging consensus as the "right" answer
- Hands-on AE with 3-7 years at startups under $10M ARR, OTE of $150K-$180K
- **Expensive for a €300K-1.5M Dutch company**, and 6-9 month ramp is significant risk
- First Round Review: "the batting average for making a successful first sales or revenue hire is especially low — sub-one-year tenures are ridiculously common"

### 5. Stay in founder-led sales longer with better systems
- The DeHart/Kazanjy philosophy: don't hire until you've built a repeatable process
- Problem: founders lack tools and frameworks to systematize what they're doing
- **This is exactly fromThoughts' opportunity**

## Where Target Founders Discuss This

### LinkedIn (primary platform)
- Dominated by US practitioners (Lemkin, Kazanjy, DeHart, Roberge)
- Dutch founders consume but rarely produce content
- **Glenn Miseroy (Expandi.io, Amsterdam, $9M ARR bootstrapped)** — exception, actively shares scaling content

### Reddit
- r/startups (1.3M subscribers), r/SaaS, r/sales, r/entrepreneur, r/indiehackers
- Raw, unfiltered questions but almost entirely US-centric
- Virtually no Dutch or European-specific discussion

### Indie Hackers
- Captures bootstrapped founder voice authentically
- Quote mirroring ICP mindset: "I've hated sales all my life. Now I am faced with a choice — hire a killer sales person (no budget), run out of money, or start loving sales."

### European communities
- **SaaStock** (Dublin) and **SaaSiest** (Nordics/Benelux) — skew later-stage
- **Techleap Scale Lab** — closest Dutch-specific, but invitation-only and higher-growth focus
- **No Dutch-language online community** where early-stage B2B founders discuss sales scaling

---

## The European-Specific Challenge

- **72% of respondents** in European B2B SaaS survey say it's harder than ever to recruit great senior sales executives (OpenView), with Germany ranked hardest
- NL slightly better (English proficiency, Amsterdam as inside sales hub) but core problem remains: talent pool of 0→1 startup salespeople is dramatically thinner in Europe vs. US
- US frameworks assume you can find an AE with 3-7 years startup experience — in the Netherlands, that profile barely exists at scale
- According to Dealroom/Techleap: only a small fraction of Dutch startups have 10+ employees. Most are bootstrapped, cautious, and allergic to anything that doesn't clearly impact revenue or runway

## Strategic Solution Taxonomy

| Category | Examples | What they do | What's missing |
|----------|----------|-------------|----------------|
| Frameworks/education | DeHart, Kazanjy, Lemkin | Tell you what to do | Can't do it for you. US-centric. Zero Dutch content. |
| Fractional consultants | SalesQuarters, Husaca, SalesViking | Expensive human labor | Limited bandwidth, no AI leverage, 10-15 companies max |
| AI SDR tools | Skarbe, Salesforge, ZELIQ | Automate execution | No strategic guidance. Don't know your ICP or win/loss patterns |
| CRMs | Attio, folk, Salesflare | Store what happened | Don't tell you what to do next |
| **fromThoughts** | — | **Applies frameworks to your specific situation** | **The gap between frameworks and execution** |

## Competitive Threats to Monitor

### Seth DeHart's Founder Led Sales Community
- Free, growing (250+ members), Point Nine Capital backing
- Currently advisory/community only — no tooling
- Could evolve into a more comprehensive platform
- **Closest thing to a competitive threat on the strategic layer for European founders**

### Skarbe
- CRM autopilot for founders, 2,500 users, freemium
- High threat on automation layer, minimal on strategic layer
- Could add strategic features over time
