## Stats Suitable for Website Use

### 1. Only 51% of SaaS AEs hit quota in 2024 — down from 66% in 2022

- **Source:** Bridge Group, *2024 SaaS AE Report* (172 B2B SaaS companies, median $24M ARR)
- **Credibility:** High — Bridge Group is the most authoritative B2B SaaS sales research firm, running this survey since 2007
- **Use context:** Website, pitch deck, sales calls
- **Why it matters for fromThoughts:** Even a good sales hire underperforms without the right process and focus. Hiring is not the fix on its own — the mechanism has to come first.

### 2. Average AE ramp time is now 5.7 months — up from 4.3 months in 2020

- **Source:** Bridge Group, *2024 SaaS AE Report*
- **Credibility:** High — same authoritative source
- **Use context:** Website, pitch deck
- **Why it matters for fromThoughts:** Your first hire is 6 months behind before they close a single deal. The process they ramp into determines whether that 6 months becomes productive or wasted.

### 3. Companies with documented sales processes grow 28% faster

- **Source:** Harvard Business Review
- **Credibility:** High — HBR is authoritative; widely cited
- **Use context:** Website, pitch deck, design partner conversations
- **Why it matters for fromThoughts:** fromThoughts is the tool that builds the documented process before (and alongside) the hire. This stat frames that as a growth driver, not an administrative overhead.
- **Note:** Locate the specific HBR article and year before using in investor materials — confirm the exact wording.

## Stats Suitable for Sales Pitch / Design Partner Conversations (not website without caveat)

### 4. 70% of first VP Sales hires in SaaS don't make it to 12 months

- **Source:** Jason Lemkin, SaaStr / 2013 Sales Hacker Conference
- **Credibility:** High name recognition, widely cited across SaaS ecosystem for 10+ years
- **Age:** 2013 — old. The SaaS market has changed significantly. Treat as directional, not precise.
- **Use context:** Pitch conversations, not as a headline stat on the website
- **Alternative framing:** Pair with the more recent Bridge Group 51% quota attainment stat for a more defensible version of the same argument.

### 5. Average VP of Sales tenure declined from 26 months to 19 months

- **Source:** Gong (Chris Orlob), published January 2018
- **Credibility:** Medium — Gong is a major sales platform, but this is from 2018 and no updated study has replicated it
- **Age:** 2018 — old. Likely worse today given market conditions, but cannot claim that without a current source.
- **Use context:** Supporting context only, not a headline claim

### 6. Founders wait ~9 months before acting on a mis-hire — despite the signal being visible in 30 days

- **Source:** Intelligent Conversations, *The True Cost of a Bad Sales Hire* (2026); SaaStr/Lemkin (30-day signal guidance)
- **Credibility:** Medium — Intelligent Conversations is a sales consulting firm; the ~9-month figure is practitioner-observed ("three quarters later, they're gone"), not a controlled study. SaaStr's 30-day signal guidance is widely cited practitioner advice.
- **Use context:** Sales calls, design partner conversations — particularly effective with post-hire founders
- **Why it matters for fromThoughts:** The gap between when the signal appears (30 days) and when founders act (~9 months) is exactly where fromThoughts operates. A weekly pipeline brief surfaces the signal before the founder has rationalised it away.

### 7. 47% of managers coach their rep less than 30 minutes per week — win rates jump from 43% to 56% when coaching exceeds 2 hours/week

- **Source:** Sales Management Association (47% under 30 min); Revegy (win rate lift from coaching investment)
- **Credibility:** Medium-High — Sales Management Association is a specialist research body; Revegy is a sales execution platform. Neither is as authoritative as Bridge Group for SaaS-specific data, but both are widely cited in sales management literature.
- **Use context:** Post-hire founder conversations — directly addresses the "I hired a rep, my time problem is solved" belief
- **Why it matters for fromThoughts:** Most founders manage their rep the same way most managers do — too little, with no system. fromThoughts provides the structure that makes 30 minutes of founder attention per week actually move the needle.

### 8. A sales rep hitting 25% of their €1M quota costs ~€850K in direct costs plus lost revenue

- **Source:** Accent Technologies, *The True Cost of a Bad Sales Rep* (2020). Calculation: direct costs (salary, benefits, tools) ~€170K + productivity loss (missed quota) ~€750K.
- **Credibility:** Medium — Accent Technologies is a sales enablement vendor; the calculation methodology is reasonable but vendor-produced. Treat as directional.
- **Age:** 2020 — likely conservative given salary inflation since then.
- **Use context:** Price objection conversations; makes the €15K/year cost look trivial by comparison
- **Why it matters for fromThoughts:** One mis-hired or under-managed rep costs 50x the annual fromThoughts subscription. This is the ROI frame.

### 9. 52% of SDRs don't last 12 months; average SDR tenure is 14 months

- **Source:** SaaStr (Jason Lemkin)
- **Credibility:** Medium — SaaStr community-sourced, widely cited, not a controlled study
- **Use context:** Supporting context for the broader "first sales hire is fragile without a process" argument
- **Why it matters for fromThoughts:** Even below the VP level, early sales hires have high failure rates. A process gives any hire — AE or SDR — something to ramp into rather than invent.

## Stats to Avoid Using Publicly

### 6. 68% of founders fail to transition from founder-led sales

- **Source:** RVNU (Wayne Morris, Founder & CEO), December 2025
- **Data basis:** Proprietary assessment data, ~200 B2B SaaS companies, no external validation or peer review
- **Verdict:** Too thin for public claims. Plausible directionally, but not citable. Do not put on website or in pitch deck.
- **Alternative:** Use the Bridge Group quota attainment stat (stat #1 above) — same message, better source.

### 7. 68% of B2B SaaS startups hit a growth ceiling after founder-led traction

- **Source:** Claimed to be "OpenView's 2024 SaaS Benchmarks" (cited by RCKT blog, Jan 2026)
- **Verdict:** Cannot verify this against the actual OpenView/High Alpha report. Likely a misattribution. Do not use.

## Key Narrative for fromThoughts (combining the above)

> *The problem is not that founders can't hire — it's that they hire before the machine exists.*
>
> Bridge Group's 2024 data shows fewer than 1 in 2 SaaS AEs hit quota. The average new hire takes 5.7 months to ramp. For a pre-first Head of Sales founder, this means your first hire costs €80–150K, is 6 months behind from day one, and has less than a 50% chance of hitting the number — unless the sales mechanism is already in place before they arrive.
>
> fromThoughts builds that mechanism with you before you hire, so your first Head of Sales can run it — not invent it.
