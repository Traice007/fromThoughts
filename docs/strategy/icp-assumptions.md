## Hard Filters — Disqualify Before Anything Else

These are not assumptions to validate. They are prerequisites. If a prospect fails any of these, do not send a message.

**1. Human-assisted sales motion (most important)**
fromThoughts requires a pipeline with real deals that humans work through stages. The founder or rep must be actively having conversations, running demos, sending proposals, and tracking where accounts are. Without this, there is nothing to review, prioritise, or manage.

Disqualified:
- Product-led growth (PLG) — users sign up and upgrade in-product, no sales conversations
- Pure self-serve with low ACV — €500/year subscriptions where individual deals don't matter
- B2C — no sales process by definition
- Community or content businesses — revenue comes from memberships or ads, not closed deals

Qualifies:
- B2B with a "Book a demo" or "Contact us" buying path
- ACVs high enough that individual deals matter (roughly €5K+ per deal)
- A visible sales team on LinkedIn (AE, BDR, Account Executive, Business Development titles)
- A pricing page that includes a "talk to us" tier

**30-second LinkedIn check before sending:**
- Look at their team page — are there people with sales titles (AE, BDR, Head of Sales)?
- Look at their pricing — is there a "Contact us" option, or is everything self-serve?
- Is the product B2B with a recognisable sales cycle? (developer tools, fintech B2B, HR software, logistics software — yes. Photography communities, consumer apps, marketplaces — no.)

**2. B2B SaaS or B2B software**
The benchmark data, the pipeline mechanics, and the ICP assumptions are all built around B2B SaaS deal cycles. A B2B services company or agency may have a pipeline but the dynamics are different enough to be out of scope at this stage.

**3. €100K–€1.5M ARR range**
Below €100K: too early — founder is still figuring out PMF, not ready for a sales mechanism.
Above €1.5M: too mature — they likely have RevOps or a proper sales leader already.

**4. NL / DE / Nordics geography**
Outreach is relationship-based and community-driven. Staying in the Dutch/German/Nordic B2B SaaS ecosystem keeps the network compounding. Global or US-first companies are out of scope for now.

## The Two ICPs: One Problem, Two Stages

fromThoughts serves one core problem — **founder sales knowledge is tacit and can't scale** — at two stages of the same journey:

| | ICP 1: Pre-Hire Founder | ICP 2: Post-Hire Founder |
|---|---|---|
| **Revenue** | €100K–€500K ARR | €500K–€1.5M ARR |
| **Team** | Founder only, or 1 non-sales person | 1–2 salespeople already hired |
| **Core pain** | "I need to document what I know before I hand this off" | "I hired someone and I'm still closing every deal myself" |
| **Urgency** | Moderate — future-oriented | High — salary clock is already ticking |
| **Product fit** | Starter (€1,500 one-time) | Pro (€15,000/year) |
| **Validation priority** | Secondary | **Primary — start here** |

**The connection:** ICP 1 becomes ICP 2. The pre-hire founder who buys Starter is the Pro customer 6–12 months later. This is not scope creep — it's a customer lifecycle and a natural land-and-expand motion.

---

## Validation Priority: Why Post-Hire First

Start design partner conversations with ICP 2. Three reasons:

1. **Urgency is real and immediate.** A founder paying €5,000/month for a rep who isn't closing has a burning problem. ICP 1 has an important problem — but not yet on fire.
2. **Budget is already proven.** They're spending €60K–€100K/year on a salesperson. €15,000/year to make that investment work is a fraction of what's already committed.
3. **The outreach message is sharper.** *"You hired your first salesperson and you're still closing every deal yourself"* creates instant recognition. ICP 1 requires more explanation.

## ICP 1: Pre-Hire Founder

**Profile in one sentence:** B2B founder at €100K–€500K ARR, still the only seller, starting to think seriously about their first commercial hire.

### Assumptions to Validate

| # | Assumption | How to validate | How to invalidate | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1.1 | They recognise their sales knowledge is non-transferable *before* experiencing the failed handoff | Ask: "If you hired a salesperson tomorrow, what would you hand them?" — do they feel the gap? | They think a CRM login and one joint call is enough | 🔲 Unvalidated |
| 1.2 | They have budget for €1,500 despite being sub-€500K | Ask about tool spend — do they already pay for HubSpot, Notion, Slack? | Budget is too tight; every euro goes to product | 🔲 Unvalidated |
| 1.3 | They are actively planning a first hire, not just vaguely thinking about it | Ask: "When do you expect to make your first commercial hire?" — is there a timeline? | No timeline; still in early PMF phase | 🔲 Unvalidated |
| 1.4 | A one-time execution plan delivers enough value at this stage | Do they act on the output? Do they reference it? | They use it once and never return | 🔲 Unvalidated |
| 1.5 | They naturally upgrade to Pro after making their first hire | Track whether Starter customers return post-hire | They churn after hire and find another solution | 🔲 Unvalidated |
| 1.6 | The €1,500 price feels fair for a one-time plan | No price objection, or objection resolves when compared to alternative cost | Consistent price objection even after anchoring against consultant cost | 🔲 Unvalidated |

---

## ICP 2: Post-Hire Founder

**Profile in one sentence:** B2B founder at €500K–€1.5M ARR who has hired 1–2 salespeople and is still closing most deals themselves — because they don't know what to tell their rep to do.

### Assumptions to Validate

| # | Assumption | How to validate | How to invalidate | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2.1 | The founder is still closing most deals despite having a salesperson | Ask: "What percentage of deals in the last quarter did you personally close?" — expect >70% | Rep is already closing independently and founder has stepped back | 🔲 Unvalidated |
| 2.2 | The founder cannot tell if poor rep performance is a people problem or a process problem | Ask: "Is your rep underperforming because of them, or because of something in how you set them up?" — expect uncertainty | Founder is clear it's one or the other | 🔲 Unvalidated |
| 2.3 | The founder does not know what the rep should be doing on a typical Tuesday | Ask: "Walk me through what your rep did last week" — expect vagueness or over-reliance on activity metrics | Founder has a structured weekly cadence with clear direction | 🔲 Unvalidated |
| 2.4 | They will pay €15,000/year if the product demonstrably helps direct the rep | Strong verbal intent + willingness to sign a design partner agreement | "I'd rather hire a fractional VP" or "too expensive" after anchoring | 🔲 Unvalidated |
| 2.5 | Their CRM is HubSpot or Pipedrive (not Salesforce, not spreadsheets) | Ask about current tool stack in first call | Salesforce (not in scope yet) or no CRM at all | 🔲 Unvalidated |
| 2.6 | They will return weekly if the product surfaces something specific about a deal they care about | Track login frequency post-onboarding | They log in once, see the output, and don't return | 🔲 Unvalidated |
| 2.7 | The first 6–12 months post-hire is the highest urgency window | Urgency is markedly higher in conversations with <12 months post-hire founders | Founders who hired >18 months ago are equally urgent | 🔲 Unvalidated |
| 2.8 | They are open to Ranjith/fromThoughts being involved in their pipeline review | No resistance to sharing pipeline data and deal-level detail | Privacy concerns or reluctance to show weak pipeline | 🔲 Unvalidated |

## Shared Assumptions (Both ICPs)

| # | Assumption | How to validate | How to invalidate | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| S.0 | Both ICPs have a human-assisted sales motion — deals require a conversation to close, not a self-serve signup | Confirmed when prospect has AE/BDR roles on team, a "Contact us" pricing path, and pipeline with named accounts | PLG or self-serve companies where no individual deal matters | 🔲 Unvalidated |
| S.1 | Dutch B2B founders at this stage use HubSpot or Pipedrive as their primary CRM | Confirmed in first 5 outreach conversations | Material number using Salesforce, Monday CRM, or spreadsheets | 🔲 Unvalidated |
| S.2 | The trigger event "posting a sales job role" reliably identifies in-window prospects | High response rate from founders actively hiring | Low conversion from job-posting-triggered outreach | 🔲 Unvalidated |
| S.3 | Dutch founders respond better to direct, problem-specific outreach than to product pitches | Higher response rate on problem-framing messages vs. feature-led messages | No significant difference in response rate | 🔲 Unvalidated |
| S.4 | The ICP is reachable through LinkedIn outreach without paid channels at early stage | 3–5 design partners secured through LinkedIn alone | Cannot reach decision-makers without warm intros or paid acquisition | 🔲 Unvalidated |
| S.5 | The €1,500 → €15,000 pricing gap does not create upgrade friction | Starter customers convert to Pro without significant price objection | Consistent resistance at the Pro price point even with clear ROI | 🔲 Unvalidated |

## Conversation Questions by ICP

### For ICP 1 (Pre-hire founder)

- *"When do you expect to make your first commercial hire?"*
- *"If you hired someone tomorrow, what would you hand them on day one?"*
- *"How much of what makes your sales approach work is written down anywhere?"*
- *"What's your biggest fear about making that hire?"*

### For ICP 2 (Post-hire founder)

- *"What percentage of deals in the last quarter did you personally close?"*
- *"Walk me through what your rep did last week — concretely."*
- *"How do you tell your rep where to focus each week?"*
- *"Is the underperformance a people problem or a process problem — how do you know?"*
- *"How do you know when a deal is about to go cold — before it's already gone?"*
- *"Show me a deal you're worried about right now."*

## How to Update This Document

After each design partner conversation or outreach response:

1. Note which assumptions were touched in the conversation
2. Update status: 🔲 Unvalidated → ✅ Validated / ❌ Invalidated / ⚠️ Partially validated
3. Add a one-line note with the evidence: what they said, what you observed
4. If an assumption is invalidated, note what the reality is — this is as valuable as validation

**Status key:**
- 🔲 Unvalidated — no evidence yet
- ✅ Validated — confirmed by multiple conversations or clear behavioural signal
- ⚠️ Partial — some signal but not conclusive, needs more data
- ❌ Invalidated — evidence contradicts the assumption; update the strategy
