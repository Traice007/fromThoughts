## Hard Filters — Disqualify Before Anything Else

These are not assumptions to validate. They are prerequisites. If a prospect fails any of these, do not send a message.

**1. Human-assisted sales motion (most important)**
fromThoughts requires a pipeline with real deals that humans work through stages. The founder or rep must be actively having conversations, running demos, sending proposals, and tracking where accounts are. Without this, there is nothing to review, prioritise, or manage.

Disqualified:
- Product-led growth (PLG) — users sign up and upgrade in-product, no sales conversations
- Pure self-serve with low ACV — €500/year subscriptions where individual deals don't matter
- B2C — no sales process by definition
- Community or content businesses — revenue comes from memberships or ads, not closed deals

Qualifies:
- B2B with a "Book a demo" or "Contact us" buying path
- ACVs high enough that individual deals matter (roughly €5K+ per deal)
- A visible sales team on LinkedIn (AE, BDR, Account Executive, Business Development titles)
- A pricing page that includes a "talk to us" tier

**30-second LinkedIn check before sending:**
- Look at their team page — are there people with sales titles (AE, BDR, Head of Sales)?
- Look at their pricing — is there a "Contact us" option, or is everything self-serve?
- Is the product B2B with a recognisable sales cycle? (developer tools, fintech B2B, HR software, logistics software — yes. Photography communities, consumer apps, marketplaces — no.)

**2. B2B SaaS or B2B software**
The benchmark data, the pipeline mechanics, and the ICP assumptions are all built around B2B SaaS deal cycles. A B2B services company or agency may have a pipeline but the dynamics are different enough to be out of scope at this stage.

**3. €100K–€1.5M ARR range**
Below €100K: too early — founder is still figuring out PMF, not ready for a sales mechanism.
Above €1.5M: too mature — they likely have RevOps or a proper sales leader already.

**4. NL / DE / Nordics geography**
Outreach is relationship-based and community-driven. Staying in the Dutch/German/Nordic B2B SaaS ecosystem keeps the network compounding. Global or US-first companies are out of scope for now.

## PMF Qualification Gate — Check Before Any Design Partner Conversation

fromThoughts cannot fix a PMF problem. A prospect with weak product-market fit will blame their failed sales transition on fromThoughts. Qualify PMF explicitly before onboarding anyone as a design partner.

**Practitioner consensus (Seth DeHart, Point Nine):** The majority of what presents as a sales execution problem in early-stage B2B SaaS is actually a positioning, PMF, or ICP problem. If PMF isn't there, no sales management layer will help.

**The four qualifying questions:**

| # | Question | Red flag | What it signals |
|---|---|---|---|
| PMF.1 | *"If you stopped all outbound tomorrow — would deals still come in?"* | "No, everything stops" | No inbound pull; value prop not compelling enough to generate word of mouth |
| PMF.2 | *"What's your NRR? Are existing customers expanding or shrinking?"* | NRR below 100% | Core value proposition not validated; existing customers are leaking |
| PMF.3 | *"How much higher is your close rate when you're personally on the call vs. your rep alone?"* | Large gap (e.g. "I close 70%, rep closes 10%") | The selling insight hasn't been made learnable yet |
| PMF.4 | *"How many customers have you won outside your personal network?"* | Fewer than 3–5 | PMF proven only within a warm network, not with strangers |

**Minimum thresholds to proceed:**
- At least 3–5 customers acquired outside personal network
- NRR ≥ 100% (or clear explanation of why it's temporarily below)
- Close rate not fully dependent on founder presence

**If a prospect fails these questions:** Do not onboard as a design partner. Handle the conversation with the protocol below.

### When a prospect fails the PMF gate — how to handle it

**The approach: be honest, refer them, keep the door open.**

Honesty builds trust even when it doesn't produce a customer. A founder who remembers that you told them the truth — when everyone else was trying to sell them something — is a future customer, a referral source, or a reference. Don't let the conversation be a dead end.

**How the conversation goes:**

1. **Name what you see, specifically.** Don't say "you're not ready." Say: *"Based on what you've described, the constraint right now isn't sales management — it's that the value proposition isn't yet learnable by someone who isn't you. If I bring in a process layer on top of that, it won't change the underlying problem."*

2. **Give them something concrete to work on.** Resources that are genuinely useful:
   - Seth DeHart (Point Nine): ["No PMF, No Sales Hire"](https://www.buzzsprout.com/2187664/episodes/14552847-no-pmf-no-sales-hire-ep-37-seth-dehart) — podcast episode, directly on point
   - April Dunford: *Obviously Awesome* (book) — the clearest framework for identifying the positioning gap
   - First Round Review: ["The Levels of Product-Market Fit"](https://www.firstround.com/levels) — diagnostic to know where you actually are

3. **Give them a concrete milestone to come back on.** *"When you have 3–5 customers you closed without leaning on your network, and your NRR is above 100% — that's when fromThoughts is the highest-leverage thing you can do. Come back then."*

4. **Stay in touch.** Add them to a simple follow-up list. A check-in in 3–6 months: *"How is it going? Where are you now?"* No pitch, just genuine interest.

**What to document after the conversation:**

- Which PMF question(s) they failed
- What they said when you named the problem — did they recognise it or push back?
- What they said they'd need help with (this is signal for a potential future offering)
- Whether they responded positively to being redirected (trust signal) or defensively (tells you something about founder self-awareness)

**Tracking whether this is a pattern:** If more than 30% of early conversations hit the PMF gate, that's a signal worth acting on. A bounded "Commercial Readiness Assessment" — a one-time paid diagnostic that tells founders exactly what needs to be true before a sales hire makes sense — could become a natural upstream product. Don't build it speculatively. Validate demand by counting how often the need appears.

## The Two ICPs: One Problem, Two Stages

fromThoughts serves one core problem — **founder sales knowledge is tacit and can't scale** — at two stages of the same journey:

| | ICP 1: Pre-Hire Founder | ICP 2: Post-Hire Founder |
|---|---|---|
| **Revenue** | €100K–€500K ARR | €500K–€1.5M ARR |
| **Headcount** | 1–3 people (founder + maybe a dev or marketer, no sales person) | 4–8 people (founder + 1–2 reps + supporting roles) — *hypothesis, to validate* |
| **Team** | Founder is the only seller | 1–2 salespeople already hired, founder still closing most deals |
| **Funding** | Bootstrapped or very early seed — *hypothesis: biggest pain, most conservative spender* | Bootstrapped or light funding — *hypothesis: at ~€1M ARR + 8 people in NL, profitable without external capital* |
| **Core pain** | "I need to document what I know before I hand this off" | "I hired someone and I'm still closing every deal myself" |
| **Urgency** | Moderate — future-oriented | High — salary clock is already ticking |
| **Product fit** | Starter (€1,500 one-time) | Pro (€15,000/year) |
| **Validation priority** | Secondary | **Primary — start here** |

**The connection:** ICP 1 becomes ICP 2. The pre-hire founder who buys Starter is the Pro customer 6–12 months later. This is not scope creep — it's a customer lifecycle and a natural land-and-expand motion.

## Refined ICP Definition — February 2026

*Added after critical market size analysis. This is the operative definition for outreach and design partner qualification. The detailed assumption tables below remain as the validation framework.*

> **Primary ICP (the only one to pursue until 5 Pro customers are signed):**
> B2B SaaS founder, NL, €400K–€1.5M ARR, first commercial hire made ≤ 15 months ago, no Head of Sales on payroll, HubSpot or Pipedrive in active use, founder's own presence still required to close most deals.

**Key refinements from February 2026 analysis:**

- **Drop the headcount filter.** 4–8 employees is too blunt. Use salesteam composition instead: no dedicated sales leader on LinkedIn, 1–2 AEs/BDRs max. A 12-person company where 9 are in product/engineering is still the right profile.
- **Add hire age as the primary urgency signal.** 0–6 months post-hire = maximum urgency. 6–15 months = high urgency. 15+ months = significantly lower urgency, higher sales friction.
- **Bootstrapped is a hypothesis, not a hard filter.** Light seed (≤ €500K raised) is equally valid. Lightly funded founders may have higher urgency due to board pressure on rep performance.
- **Pre-hire ICP (ICP 1) is explicitly deprioritised** until 5 Pro customers are signed and retention is proven. Do not split focus.
- **The window is short.** Maximum pain lasts 12–15 months post-hire. A constant flow of new companies entering this window is required — this is a flow business, not a stock business. NL alone (~60 new companies/year entering the window) is not enough for long-term scale. See `docs/strategy/growth-strategy.md` for the full market size analysis and €10M ARR path.

## Validation Priority: Why Post-Hire First

Start design partner conversations with ICP 2. Three reasons:

1. **Urgency is real and immediate.** A founder paying €5,000/month for a rep who isn't closing has a burning problem. ICP 1 has an important problem — but not yet on fire.
2. **Budget is already proven.** They're spending €60K–€100K/year on a salesperson. €15,000/year to make that investment work is a fraction of what's already committed.
3. **The outreach message is sharper.** *"You hired your first salesperson and you're still closing every deal yourself"* creates instant recognition. ICP 1 requires more explanation.

## ICP 1: Pre-Hire Founder

**Profile in one sentence:** Solo B2B founder at €100K–€500K ARR — possibly with a developer or marketer alongside them — who is still the only person selling, and starting to think seriously about their first commercial hire.

### Assumptions to Validate

| # | Assumption | How to validate | How to invalidate | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1.1 | They recognise their sales knowledge is non-transferable *before* experiencing the failed handoff | Ask: "If you hired a salesperson tomorrow, what would you hand them?" — do they feel the gap? | They think a CRM login and one joint call is enough | 🔲 Unvalidated |
| 1.2 | They have budget for €1,500 despite being sub-€500K | Ask about tool spend — do they already pay for HubSpot, Notion, Slack? | Budget is too tight; every euro goes to product | 🔲 Unvalidated |
| 1.3 | They are actively planning a first hire, not just vaguely thinking about it | Ask: "When do you expect to make your first commercial hire?" — is there a timeline? | No timeline; still in early PMF phase | 🔲 Unvalidated |
| 1.4 | A one-time execution plan delivers enough value at this stage | Do they act on the output? Do they reference it? | They use it once and never return | 🔲 Unvalidated |
| 1.5 | They naturally upgrade to Pro after making their first hire | Track whether Starter customers return post-hire | They churn after hire and find another solution | 🔲 Unvalidated |
| 1.6 | The €1,500 price feels fair for a one-time plan | No price objection, or objection resolves when compared to alternative cost | Consistent price objection even after anchoring against consultant cost | 🔲 Unvalidated |
| 1.7 | The pre-hire ICP is 1–3 people total (founder + possibly a dev or marketer, no sales hire yet) | LinkedIn team pages show 1–3 people, none with sales titles | Pre-hire founders consistently have 4+ people already | 🔲 Unvalidated |
| 1.8 | Bootstrapped pre-hire founders feel the most acute pain — they can't afford a failed hire | Strong urgency signal in conversations; no mention of investor budget | Funded founders show equal or higher urgency | 🔲 Unvalidated |

---

## ICP 2: Post-Hire Founder

**Profile in one sentence:** B2B founder at €500K–€1.5M ARR with 4–8 people on payroll, who has hired 1–2 salespeople and is still closing most deals themselves — because they don't know what to tell their rep to do. At ~€1M ARR with 8 employees in the Netherlands, likely profitable without external funding — which makes every hire high-stakes and every mistake expensive. *(Headcount and funding hypotheses — to validate.)*

### Assumptions to Validate

| # | Assumption | How to validate | How to invalidate | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2.1 | The founder is still closing most deals despite having a salesperson | Ask: "What percentage of deals in the last quarter did you personally close?" — expect >70% | Rep is already closing independently and founder has stepped back | 🔲 Unvalidated |
| 2.2 | The founder cannot tell if poor rep performance is a people problem or a process problem | Ask: "Is your rep underperforming because of them, or because of something in how you set them up?" — expect uncertainty | Founder is clear it's one or the other | 🔲 Unvalidated |
| 2.3 | The founder does not know what the rep should be doing on a typical Tuesday | Ask: "Walk me through what your rep did last week" — expect vagueness or over-reliance on activity metrics | Founder has a structured weekly cadence with clear direction | 🔲 Unvalidated |
| 2.4 | They will pay €15,000/year if the product demonstrably helps direct the rep | Strong verbal intent + willingness to sign a design partner agreement | "I'd rather hire a fractional VP" or "too expensive" after anchoring | 🔲 Unvalidated |
| 2.5 | Their CRM is HubSpot or Pipedrive (not Salesforce, not spreadsheets) | Ask about current tool stack in first call | Salesforce (not in scope yet) or no CRM at all | 🔲 Unvalidated |
| 2.6 | They will return weekly if the product surfaces something specific about a deal they care about | Track login frequency post-onboarding | They log in once, see the output, and don't return | 🔲 Unvalidated |
| 2.7 | The first 6–12 months post-hire is the highest urgency window | Urgency is markedly higher in conversations with <12 months post-hire founders | Founders who hired >18 months ago are equally urgent | 🔲 Unvalidated |
| 2.8 | They are open to Ranjith/fromThoughts being involved in their pipeline review | No resistance to sharing pipeline data and deal-level detail | Privacy concerns or reluctance to show weak pipeline | 🔲 Unvalidated |
| 2.9 | The post-hire sweet spot is 4–8 employees total — below 4 they haven't hired yet, above 10 the transition is already behind them | Confirmed when companies in the 4–8 range consistently show the right pain; 10+ feel past it | No meaningful difference in pain between 4 and 15 employees | ⚠️ Partial — first outreach observation (Feb 2026): 10+ employee companies appear past the transition |
| 2.10 | Bootstrapped post-hire founders feel higher urgency than funded founders — every salary is real money, not runway | Stronger urgency language, faster decision-making in conversations | Funded founders equally or more urgent due to board pressure | 🔲 Unvalidated |
| 2.11 | At ~€1M ARR with 8 people in NL, the company is profitable without external capital needed — making the founder more conservative but the ROI argument stronger | Founder confirms bootstrapped or minimal funding; responds strongly to cost-of-failed-hire framing | Material number are VC-backed at this stage | 🔲 Unvalidated |

## Shared Assumptions (Both ICPs)

| # | Assumption | How to validate | How to invalidate | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| S.0 | Both ICPs have a human-assisted sales motion — deals require a conversation to close, not a self-serve signup | Confirmed when prospect has AE/BDR roles on team, a "Contact us" pricing path, and pipeline with named accounts | PLG or self-serve companies where no individual deal matters | 🔲 Unvalidated |
| S.1 | Dutch B2B founders at this stage use HubSpot or Pipedrive as their primary CRM | Confirmed in first 5 outreach conversations | Material number using Salesforce, Monday CRM, or spreadsheets | 🔲 Unvalidated |
| S.2 | The trigger event "posting a sales job role" reliably identifies in-window prospects | High response rate from founders actively hiring | Low conversion from job-posting-triggered outreach | 🔲 Unvalidated |
| S.3 | Dutch founders respond better to direct, problem-specific outreach than to product pitches | Higher response rate on problem-framing messages vs. feature-led messages | No significant difference in response rate | 🔲 Unvalidated |
| S.4 | The ICP is reachable through LinkedIn outreach without paid channels at early stage | 3–5 design partners secured through LinkedIn alone | Cannot reach decision-makers without warm intros or paid acquisition | 🔲 Unvalidated |
| S.5 | The €1,500 → €15,000 pricing gap does not create upgrade friction | Starter customers convert to Pro without significant price objection | Consistent resistance at the Pro price point even with clear ROI | 🔲 Unvalidated |
| S.6 | The headcount sweet spot is 4–8 employees for ICP 2 and 1–3 for ICP 1 — companies at 10+ have already made the transition and feel a different pain | Consistent pattern across outreach: 10+ employee companies are past the window | No meaningful difference in pain at 8 vs. 15 employees | ⚠️ Partial — first outreach observation (Feb 2026): 10+ employee companies visibly past the transition point on LinkedIn |
| S.7 | Bootstrapped founders are the highest-pain segment — they feel urgency most acutely because every hire is real money, not runway | Bootstrapped founders show stronger urgency and faster decision-making | Funded founders equally urgent due to board pressure for growth | 🔲 Unvalidated |
| S.8 | LinkedIn company size filter (11–50) is too broad — use profile-level signals (team composition, job postings, founding year) to find the 4–8 employee sweet spot | Better conversion rate from profile-level qualification vs. company size filter alone | Company size filter alone is sufficient | ⚠️ Partial — Feb 2026: LinkedIn filter confirmed too blunt; 1–10 bucket too wide |

### For ICP 1 (Pre-hire founder)

- *"When do you expect to make your first commercial hire?"*
- *"If you hired someone tomorrow, what would you hand them on day one?"*
- *"How much of what makes your sales approach work is written down anywhere?"*
- *"What's your biggest fear about making that hire?"*

### For ICP 2 (Post-hire founder)

- *"What percentage of deals in the last quarter did you personally close?"*
- *"Walk me through what your rep did last week — concretely."*
- *"How do you tell your rep where to focus each week?"*
- *"Is the underperformance a people problem or a process problem — how do you know?"*

## How to Update This Document

After each design partner conversation or outreach response:

1. Note which assumptions were touched in the conversation
2. Update status: 🔲 Unvalidated → ✅ Validated / ❌ Invalidated / ⚠️ Partially validated
3. Add a one-line note with the evidence: what they said, what you observed
4. If an assumption is invalidated, note what the reality is — this is as valuable as validation

**Status key:**
- 🔲 Unvalidated — no evidence yet
- ✅ Validated — confirmed by multiple conversations or clear behavioural signal
- ⚠️ Partial — some signal but not conclusive, needs more data
- ❌ Invalidated — evidence contradicts the assumption; update the strategy
