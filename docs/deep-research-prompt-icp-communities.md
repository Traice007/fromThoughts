# Deep Research Prompt: Finding B2B Founders with Small Sales Teams (NL, BE, Nordics)

*Copy this entire prompt into Claude.ai Deep Research*

---

I'm the founder of fromThoughts (fromthoughts.com), an AI-powered revenue execution platform. I need to find a very specific type of B2B founder for outreach across the Netherlands, Belgium, and the Nordics (Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Finland).

## My target ICP (be precise about this)

I'm NOT looking for solo founders making their first sales hire. I'm looking for:

- **B2B tech/SaaS founders** (or co-founders acting as CEO/commercial lead)
- **Company size: 3-10 employees**, with **at least 1 dedicated sales/BD rep already on the team**
- **Revenue range: approximately €500K-€2M** (they've proven the product works, but the sales motion isn't scaling)
- **The founder is still heavily involved in sales** even though they have a rep — they're the bottleneck
- **They need a sales manager/commercial manager** but can't justify a €80K-120K hire yet
- **Geography: Netherlands, Belgium (Flanders primarily), Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Finland**
- **Bootstrapped or seed-funded** (not Series A+ with big budgets)

## What I need you to find

### 1. Online communities where these founders gather
Search exhaustively for:

**Discord servers:**
- European startup/SaaS Discord communities
- Dutch entrepreneur Discord servers
- Nordic startup Discord servers
- B2B sales-focused Discord servers where founders (not just salespeople) participate
- Search terms: "European startup Discord", "SaaS founders Discord", "B2B sales Discord", "Nederlandse ondernemers Discord", "Nordic founders Discord", "Scandinavian startups Discord"

**Slack communities:**
- European founder Slack groups
- SaaS-specific Slack communities with European membership
- Country-specific: Dutch Startup Slack, Belgian Tech Slack, Stockholm Startup Slack, Copenhagen Founders Slack, Oslo Founders Slack, Helsinki Startup Slack
- Search terms: "European founders Slack", "SaaS community Slack", "B2B founders Slack Europe"

**Reddit:**
- Which subreddits do European B2B founders with small teams frequent? Beyond r/startups and r/SaaS, are there country-specific subreddits?
- r/Netherlands business threads, r/Belgium startup threads, r/Sweden entrepreneur discussions
- Any specific threads where founders discuss managing their first sales rep or needing a sales manager

**LinkedIn groups:**
- Active LinkedIn groups for B2B founders in NL, BE, Nordics
- Sales leadership groups where early-stage founders participate
- Groups specifically about scaling from founder-led sales

**Facebook groups:**
- Dutch entrepreneur Facebook groups (these exist and are sometimes more active than you'd expect)
- Belgian startup Facebook groups
- Nordic founder Facebook groups

**Forums and communities:**
- Indie Hackers — any European sub-communities or threads about managing sales reps?
- Hacker News — European founder threads about sales scaling?
- ProductHunt community discussions
- Country-specific forums: Tweakers.net (NL, tech community), StartupJuncture community
- The Hub (thehub.io) — community features beyond job boards?

**WhatsApp/Telegram groups:**
- These are common in the Dutch startup scene. Are any publicly discoverable?
- Any Telegram groups for European B2B founders?

### 2. Events and meetups where they show up
For each country (NL, BE, SE, DK, NO, FI), find:

- **Regular meetups** (monthly/quarterly) focused on B2B sales, startup scaling, or commercial growth
- **Annual conferences** where this founder profile attends (not the big 5,000-person events — the smaller 100-300 person events where you can actually have conversations)
- **Meetup.com groups** for B2B founders, SaaS, or commercial scaling in each country/major city
- **Accelerator demo days** that are open to the public
- Specific cities to search: Amsterdam, Rotterdam, Utrecht, Eindhoven (NL); Brussels, Antwerp, Ghent (BE); Stockholm, Gothenburg (SE); Copenhagen (DK); Oslo (NO); Helsinki (FI)

### 3. How to identify these companies at scale
What tools or data sources can I use to build a list of companies matching my ICP?

- **LinkedIn Sales Navigator** — what filters would identify companies with 3-10 employees, B2B tech, with at least one person with "Sales", "BD", or "Account Executive" in their title?
- **Dealroom** — can I filter for this specific profile?
- **Techleap Finder** — beyond what's publicly available?
- **Crunchbase** — filters for seed-funded, 3-10 employees, B2B, NL/BE/Nordics?
- **Apollo.io, Clay, or similar** — outreach tools that can identify this pattern?
- **Job boards** — companies that previously posted sales roles (Indeed, The Hub, LinkedIn Jobs) as a historical signal that they have a sales rep
- **Any country-specific company databases**: KVK (NL), KBO/BCE (BE), Bolagsverket (SE), CVR (DK), Brønnøysund (NO), PRH (FI)?

### 4. Podcasts and newsletters they consume
For each country/region, what podcasts and newsletters do B2B founders at this stage actually listen to/read?

- NL-specific: Dutch-language and English-language
- BE-specific: Dutch-language (Flanders) and English
- Nordics: mostly English but flag any local-language ones with significant audiences
- Focus on podcasts/newsletters that discuss commercial scaling, sales hiring, founder-led sales — not generic startup content

### 5. Founder communities and peer networks
- **Accelerator alumni networks** — which accelerators in each country produce B2B companies that would now be at this stage (graduated 1-3 years ago)?
- **Angel investor networks** — which angel groups invest in B2B seed-stage in these countries?
- **Peer advisory groups** — like EO (Entrepreneurs' Organization), Vistage, or YPO chapters in these countries. Are there cheaper/more accessible alternatives for earlier-stage founders?
- **Government-backed programs** — like nlgroeit (NL). What are the equivalents in BE, SE, DK, NO, FI?
- **VC-backed communities** — which VCs in these countries have active portfolio founder communities?

### 6. People to follow and engage with
Who are the equivalent of Seth DeHart or Jason Lemkin in the NL/BE/Nordic ecosystem? Specifically:
- People who post about B2B sales scaling for early-stage companies
- People who coach or advise founders on their first sales hires
- Sales leaders who came from startups and now share their experience publicly
- Anyone with a significant following among B2B founders in these countries

## Format

For each finding, provide:
- **Name/URL** of the community, event, tool, or person
- **Estimated size/activity level** (dead communities aren't useful)
- **Country/region** it primarily serves
- **How to access it** (open, invite-only, paid, etc.)
- **Relevance score** (1-5) for how likely my target ICP is to be found there

Organize by country first (NL, BE, SE, DK, NO, FI), then by category within each country. Add a "Pan-European" section at the end for communities that span multiple countries.
