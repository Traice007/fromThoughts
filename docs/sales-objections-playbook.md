# fromThoughts - Sales Objections Playbook

Use this document to prepare for early customer conversations and refine your responses based on real feedback.

## Price Objections

### "€1,500 for 30 days feels steep"

**Your response:**
_Compare to the cost of a failed first hire (€150K+ salary + opportunity cost + 6-12 months lost). This is less than 1% of that risk._

**Notes / What you're hearing:**


---

### "I can use ChatGPT to generate OKRs myself"

**Your response:**
_Generic AI doesn't have benchmark data or understand your specific funnel gaps. It can generate OKRs, but it can't tell you which ones to prioritize based on where you're underperforming vs. similar companies._

**Notes / What you're hearing:**


---

### "€15K/year is a lot for a small team"

**Your response:**
_Still 90% less than a Head of Sales, and you get ongoing tracking and updates as your business evolves. The Starter plan at €1,500 is a lower-commitment way to start._

**Notes / What you're hearing:**


---

## "Do I Really Need This?" Objections

### "I'm still figuring out sales myself"

**Your response:**
_That's exactly when you need to document what's working — before you forget or before you hire someone who can't read your mind. The playbook captures your founder intuition._

**Notes / What you're hearing:**


---

### "My process is too unique for a template"

**Your response:**
_This isn't a template. The tool generates custom OKRs based on your specific metrics, gaps, and targets. Two companies with the same revenue can get completely different recommendations based on their funnel._

**Notes / What you're hearing:**


---

### "I'll just hire someone smart and let them figure it out"

**Your response:**
_That's the exact pattern that leads to failed first hires. They spend 3-6 months trying to reverse-engineer what you know intuitively. Most don't make it. A playbook gives them a foundation from day one._

**Notes / What you're hearing:**


---

## Timing Objections

### "I'm not ready to hire a salesperson yet"

**Your response:**
_That's the ideal time to build the playbook — when you're still close to the deals and remember why they closed. By the time you're ready to hire, you'll have a documented process ready to hand over._

**Notes / What you're hearing:**


---

### "I need to focus on product/fundraising first"

**Your response:**
_This takes under 10 minutes. And having a clear revenue plan actually helps fundraising conversations — investors want to see you've thought about go-to-market._

**Notes / What you're hearing:**


---

### "Founder-led sales is working fine for now"

**Your response:**
_That's great — it means you have something worth documenting. The question is: what happens when you can't be in every deal? The playbook is how you scale yourself._

**Notes / What you're hearing:**


---

## Trust & Credibility Objections

### "Where does the benchmark data come from?"

**Your response:**
_[Be ready to explain your data sources — you mention 10,000+ companies. What's the actual source?]_

**Notes / What you're hearing:**


---

### "Do you have case studies or testimonials?"

**Your response:**
_We're early — I'd love to document your journey as a founding customer. In exchange, I can offer [extended access / discount / direct input into the product]._

**Notes / What you're hearing:**


---

### "Will this company still exist in a year?"

**Your response:**
_Valid question for any new tool. That's why everything exports to PDF — you keep the playbook regardless of what happens to us. It's yours._

**Notes / What you're hearing:**


---

### "I've never heard of fromThoughts"

**Your response:**
_We're new and focused on a specific problem: helping founders like you prepare for their first sales hire. Happy to show you a demo or let you try it._

**Notes / What you're hearing:**


---

## Skepticism About Output Quality

### "AI gives generic advice"

**Your response:**
_Let me show you an example. The gap analysis is specific to your numbers — it tells you exactly where you're underperforming vs. benchmarks and what to prioritize. Not generic platitudes._

**Notes / What you're hearing:**


---

### "How do I know the recommendations are right?"

**Your response:**
_You're the expert on your business. This surfaces blind spots and priorities based on data — it doesn't replace your judgment. Think of it as a second opinion backed by benchmarks._

**Notes / What you're hearing:**


---

### "My advisor/investors already help with this"

**Your response:**
_They give high-level strategic direction — "focus on enterprise" or "improve retention." This gives you a documented playbook with specific key results your hire can execute on day one._

**Notes / What you're hearing:**


---

## Implementation Concerns

### "I don't know my conversion rates"

**Your response:**
_That's actually valuable to discover. The tool helps you realize what you don't know — and estimate it. That clarity alone is worth the 10 minutes._

**Notes / What you're hearing:**


---

### "I don't have time for this"

**Your response:**
_It takes under 10 minutes to complete. Compare that to the hours you'd spend briefing a consultant or writing a job description for a Head of Sales._

**Notes / What you're hearing:**


---

### "Will my hire actually use this?"

**Your response:**
_It's designed for handoff — PDF export, clear priorities, timeframes, and specific key results. It's what they'd spend their first month trying to create themselves._

**Notes / What you're hearing:**


---

## The Hardest Objection

> "I can just hire someone good and they'll figure it out."

This is the core belief you're challenging. Your best weapons:

1. **Stories/data about first sales hires failing** — because there was no foundation
2. **The "what would you hand them on day one?" question** — surfaces the gap
3. **The cost comparison** — €1,500 vs. €150K+ failed hire

---

## Discovery Questions (Use Before Pitching)

These open conversations without selling and surface whether they feel the pain:

1. "Have you thought about what you'd hand to your first sales hire on day one?"

2. "What's your current plan for documenting your sales process before you hire?"

3. "Have you seen first sales hires fail at other companies? What do you think went wrong?"

4. "How much of your sales process lives in your head vs. written down somewhere?"

5. "If you got hit by a bus tomorrow, could someone else close your pipeline?"
